Overview
--------

It requires SDL2 to run. Run it with:

    ./cycle

To specify the number of cells in the game and the resolution to render it by,
run it with:

    ./cycle [Board_x Board_y] [Screen_x Screen_y]

To close the program, press the escape key.

To make a recording of the game, press 0. Every frame rendered will be written
out as a .tga picture inside an "images" directory. Press 0 again to stop
recording.
