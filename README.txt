Overview
--------

It requires SDL2 to run. Run it with:

    ./cycle

To specify the number of palyers, number of cells in the game, and the
resolution to render it by, run it with:

    ./cycle [num_players] [Board_x Board_y] [Screen_x Screen_y]

To close the program, press the escape key.

To make a recording of the game, press 0. Every frame rendered will be written
out as a .tga picture inside an "images" directory. Press 0 again to stop
recording.
